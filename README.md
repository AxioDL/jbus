## JBus

This is a library for communicating with emulated GameBoy Advance instances
using the JoyBus protocol linked over TCP.

Currently, only [VBA-M](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m)
is known to function. It uses the same networking method as the
[Dolphin](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) GameCube emulator.

### Documentation

[Doxygen docs are available!](http://axiodl.github.io/jbus)

### Example

[Refer to the `joyboot.cpp`](https://github.com/AxioDL/jbus/blob/master/tools/joyboot.cpp)
implementation for a good usage example.
