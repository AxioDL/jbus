## JBus

This is a library for communicating with emulated GameBoy Advance instances
using the JoyBus protocol, linked over TCP.

Currently, only [VBA-M](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m)
is known to function. It uses the same networking method as the
[Dolphin](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) GameCube emulator.
